# Classification-of-Microplastics-using-Hyperspectral-Imagery
The code submitted to compliment the dissertation with the title 'Classification of Microplastics using Hyperspectral Imagery'

Two notebooks are available:

Notebook 1: Project_02072025.ipynb which includes: 

1. Image processing pipeline - ROI
2. Dataset creation
3. EDA
4. Evaluation Tools code
5. All classification methods used & results

The trained models produce .pkl or .pth files to be used for the inference notebook.

Notebook 2: InferenceNotebook.ipynb

Uses the .pkl or .pth files generated by Notebook 1 to use on new images.
