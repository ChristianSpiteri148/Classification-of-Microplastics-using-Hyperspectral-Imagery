# Classification-of-Microplastics-using-Hyperspectral-Imagery
This repository hosts the project “Classification of Microplastics using Hyperspectral Imagery”, which investigates the use of machine learning techniques applied to hyperspectral images (400–1000 nm) for classifying microplastics according to their polymer type.

Two notebooks are available:

Notebook 1: Project_02072025.ipynb which includes: 

  1. Data preprocessing and segmentation
  2. Feature extraction and dataset construction
  3.  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  4. Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
  5. Model training and evaluation
  6. Visualisation and reporting tools

The trained models produce .pkl or .pth files to be used for the inference notebook. These are also available in a separate folder named `Pre-trained Models'

Notebook 2: InferenceNotebook.ipynb

Uses the .pkl or .pth files generated by Notebook 1 to use on new images.


All code is documented and organised to ensure full reproducibility of the results discussed in this dissertation.
