# Classification-of-Microplastics-using-Hyperspectral-Imagery
This repository hosts the project “Classification of Microplastics using Hyperspectral Imagery”, which investigates the use of machine learning techniques applied to hyperspectral images (400–1000 nm) for classifying microplastics according to their polymer type.

Two notebooks are available:

Notebook 1: Project_02072025.ipynb which includes: 

1. Image processing pipeline - ROI
2. Dataset creation
3. EDA
4. Evaluation Tools code
5. All classification methods used & results

The trained models produce .pkl or .pth files to be used for the inference notebook.

Notebook 2: InferenceNotebook.ipynb

Uses the .pkl or .pth files generated by Notebook 1 to use on new images.
